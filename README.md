# Optimization with simulated annealing

Two examples of naive simulated annealing applications:

`python example_1.py` - traveling salesman task

`python example_2.py` - generating valid sudoku grid from a given random state

# How to start

All examples whould work straight out of the box. Parameters like max/min temperature or anneling profile are straight forward how to change.
