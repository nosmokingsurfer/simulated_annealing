# Optimization with simulated annealing

Two examples of naive simulated annealing applications:
`example_1.py - traveling salesman task`
`example_2.py - generating valid sudoku grid from a given random state`

# How to start

All examples whould work straight out of the box. Parameters like max/min temperature or anneling profile are straight forward how to change.
